This is a Virtual Library that I made with Vanilla JavaScript, HTMl, & CSS. It allows the user to add and delte books, as well as mark them as Read or Not Read. The project implements Local Storage to save the inputed books on the user's machine.

The Project was made as part of The Odin Project's curriculum and taught me about Object Constructors.
